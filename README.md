# purescript-pux-form-example

This is a project demonstrating how to use [`purescript-pux-form`](https://github.com/b123400/purescript-pux-form).

- Look at `/src/App/State.purs` for state and lens setup.
- Look at `/src/App/Events.purs` for events and `foldp` example.
- Look at `/src/App/View/Homepage.purs` for form rendering and fields setup.

This project is based on [`pux-starter-app`](https://github.com/alexmingoia/pux-starter-app).

A live version of the code is here: https://b123400.github.io/purescript-pux-form-example/
